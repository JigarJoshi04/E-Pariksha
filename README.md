# E-Pariksha
E-Pariksha - an interactive tool for teachers
<br>

## Problem Statement
<li>Precovid 36% of education was dependent upon e-learning in some way. Today that number is around 70%.

<li>Sudden shift in the teaching style, grading mechanism did not provided universities, teachers and students ample amount of time to get used to the learning management softwares.

<li>Most of the teachers in colleges are old aged and they are already having long screen-time due to online classes.

<li>It is difficult for them to go through the submitted answer sheets of every student, grade them, store marks, create result due to resource limitation and they being not so habitual to the softwares.

<li>Conduction of exams in a more secure way was a necessity. Current learning management system restricts subjective mode of examination by limiting students to only type the answers and not submit any diagrams.



## Our Solution

We are hoping to hack a solution that solves all the above problems. We want to create a dedicated etsting platform where teachers can form question papers with objective and subjectie questions. Students will be able to take the exams, see the timer, write subjective answers in more user friendly manner. Teachers can either grade the students manually by checking the answers or they will be gien an option to automatically grade the students. In the second option they have to provide answer key containing right answers of the objective and subjecive questions. Our ML model in the background will assses the student answer and willl grade them.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
1)   DJango (For web app)
2)   Tensorflow or sklearn (For ML model)
3)   HTML/CSS/JS (For Frontend)
