E-Pariksha - an interactive tool for teachers
<br>

## Problem Statement
Today, in the current scenario and the increase in the distance learning or e-education, managing online examinations have became an essentail problem. It is hard for teachers of older age to spend hours and hours of screen time in grading the answers of the students. Universities have their leaning manaugement system in place but no provision are done for the examination and they are mostly relied on google forms, where subjective questions cannot be answered over a certain limit.


## Our Solution

We are hoping to hack a solution that solves all the above problems. We want to create a dedicated etsting platform where teachers can form question papers with objective and subjectie questions. Students will be able to take the exams, see the timer, write subjective answers in more user friendly manner. Teachers can either grade the students manually by checking the answers or they will be gien an option to automatically grade the students. In the second option they have to provide answer key containing right answers of the objective and subjecive questions. Our ML model in the background will assses the student answer and willl grade them.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
1)   DJango (For web app)
2)   Tensorflow or sklearn (For ML model)
3)   HTML/CSS/JS (For Frontend)
